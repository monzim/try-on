# Try On

## Project Overview

The **Try On** application allows users to virtually try on clothes without physically wearing them. Using advanced Diffusion models, the app provides a realistic visualization of users in selected outfits. The application consists of a JavaFX frontend and a Spring Boot backend, supported by PostgreSQL for user data storage and AWS S3 for image storage.
